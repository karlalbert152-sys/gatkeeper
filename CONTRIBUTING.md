# Contributing to GatKeeper

Thank you for your interest in contributing to GatKeeper! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing.

## 🎯 First Time Contributors

Look for issues labeled **`good first issue`** — they are specifically scoped for newcomers.

## 🚀 Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Rust** 1.75+ ([install](https://rustup.rs/))
- **Git**
- **Node.js** 22+ (for PDF generation scripts)
- **Ollama** (optional, for local LLM testing)

### Clone & Build

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/karlalbert152-sys/gatkeeper.git
cd gatkeeper

# Build the project
cargo build

# Run tests
cargo test

# Check for lint issues
cargo clippy -- -D warnings

# Format code
cargo fmt
```

## 📝 Making Changes

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names:
- `feat/add-new-agent` — New feature
- `fix/resolve-sql-injection-false-positive` — Bug fix
- `docs/update-readme` — Documentation
- `refactor/agent-orchestrator` — Refactoring
- `test/add-security-agent-tests` — Tests

### Commit Messages

Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

```
feat(agents): add XSS detection patterns to SecurityAgent
fix(parser): handle empty source files gracefully
docs: update CONTRIBUTING.md with setup instructions
test(core): add risk score calculation tests
refactor(subconscious): extract scheduler into separate module
```

### Code Style

- **Rust**: Follow `rustfmt` defaults (run `cargo fmt`)
- **No comments** unless explicitly requested
- **Use `thiserror`** for error types
- **Use `tracing`** for logging (not `println!`)
- **Use `async`** with Tokio for I/O-bound operations
- **Keep functions focused** — single responsibility

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run specific crate tests
cargo test -p gatkeeper-core
cargo test -p gatkeeper-agents

# Run with output
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

When adding new functionality:
1. Add unit tests in the same file (if small) or `tests/` module
2. Add integration tests in `tests/` directory
3. Ensure `cargo clippy` passes

## 🔀 Pull Request Process

2. **Create** your branch from `main`
3. **Make** your changes
4. **Run** `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy`
5. **Run** `cargo test` and ensure all pass
6. **Write** a clear PR description explaining:

   - How to test it
7. **Request** a review from a maintainer
